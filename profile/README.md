tl;dr: we are preparing to live by end this year


We’re proud to share that iotlabs.id is currently under development, a platform designed to empower the next generation of innovators to explore, create, and collaborate in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.

Although we have not made a public announcement yet, we are open for early contributors and researchers who wish to be part with us.

If you’re passionate about IoT, technology, or research collaboration, we’d love to hear from you.
Our email is open for inquiries and partnerships: almajidnaufal@gmail.com
